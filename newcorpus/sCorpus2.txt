When choosing a partner for life what do people usually think of? A recent study has shown that these following factors are the most important things that one takes into consideration when choosing his/her partner. Firstly, beauty is an important factor.  Although many people say that the partnerâ€™s appearance is not important, research has shown that beauty has great effect. Secondly, money is also as important as appearance. Rich people are easier to attract the opposite sex than the poor. Both men and women say that they think much on how much money their partners have before they decide to get married. In addition, timing is important, if the partner comes in time, marriage is more possible. Do you see? If your partner comes when you are available or eager to love, he will be accepted easily.
